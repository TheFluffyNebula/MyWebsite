        I programmed this for my final project in Advanced Computer Programming. 
        One of my favorite games as a kid was 40x Escape by Bart Bonte. So, when the 
        opportunity presented itself in the form of making a more advanced GUI with 
        Maven and JavaFX, I made my own mini-version, complete with faithful renditions 
        of some of its most iconic levels, some of my own ideas, and the beautiful credits screen. 
        The most challenging part was getting the GUIs to interact and switch to one another, and 
        after that it was figuring out the logic and effects. 
        Unfortunately, like my Conway's Game of Life project, I don't have Maven setup yet, and 
        these are screenshots for really early development stages.
