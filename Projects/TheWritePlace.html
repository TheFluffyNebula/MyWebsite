        Date: June to October 2022 <br>
        This is by far and away the largest project I've ever been a part of.
        In May 2022, we pitched the idea for the Ready, Set, App! Contest, of which we got 3rd place. 
        My best friend Eric Wang and I wanted to see how far we could take the app, 
        We worked on the Android side during the summer, and I made the website side during the school 
        year which can be seen in the repo. We used webpack to put it all together. I was actually 
        planning to submit the Builder Base Guide Website for my final project for my Web 
        Development class but my professor and I decided it was too simple. Thus, I went with 
        this instead, and 200+ commits later, the result is beautiful but not secure at all. <br> <br>
        DO NOT ENTER ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION IF YOU DECIDE TO TEST IT <br> <br>
        The app and website can create users that can interact with each other and give feedback 
        on essays. They can also query based on tags. There's a review, upload, and feedback section. 
        The authentication and database are done through firebase, as shown below. 
        I hope to learn enough about cybersecurity to go back one day and make it secure enough for schools to use.
