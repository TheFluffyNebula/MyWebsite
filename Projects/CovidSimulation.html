        I programmed this with Cintong He, a fellow student at The Early College at Guilford.
        We made it for our final project for Scientific Computing. It uses 
        Python Turtle Graphics to simulate COVID as well as show how effective vaccines and
        quarantining could be. We also added two modes, flu and "Plague, Inc." Flu is where 
        people are immune upon recovery, and plague is where people cannot recover. It uses
        probability to simulate a circle's condition. Green is healthy, yellow is infected, red is dead, 
        and blue is immune (only present in flu mode). We also implemented a distance factor, which extends 
        the probabilities for however far the circles are away. The graph at the end uses 
        matplotlib to show the circles' conditions over time.
