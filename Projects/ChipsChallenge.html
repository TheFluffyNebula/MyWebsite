        This project was for my CSC411 class, Intro to Artificial Intelligence. The last problem set was Chip's Challenge, 
        with one of the levels shown below. The goal is to collect all of the chips and then reach the portal. 
        We were given a Java robot with some perceive methods and had to fill out a 'getAction' method returning an action 
        like 'go up' or 'go right' on each iteration of the simulation.

        The method used to tackle this problem is 'Planning'. When discovering an object (ex. a door) in the way of 
        getting a chip, a new subtask is pushed onto a stack, and the robot recomputes the path to the new subtask (the key). 
        Once the robot reaches the subtask and picks the key up, the subtask is popped from the stack. Eventually, once all of the 
        chips are collected, the final subtask is the portal's location. A* search with the Manhattan distance heuristic was used 
        to compute the paths. A video of the solution running is below.
