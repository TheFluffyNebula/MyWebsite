        I programmed this for my final project for in Calculus 3. For this project, 
        I asked myself what would happen if I combined two of my dartboards at home, 
        which would in theory help me as a novice dart thrower, since darts that are 
        closer to the outside receive a higher multiplier. I first computed the expected 
        value of a throw by hand through integration and adding up all segments. I then 
        computed the expected value of a throw via simulation. One of my favorite memories 
        was sitting down at my laptop and working for 3-4 hours straight to draw the dartboard. 
        Overall, I was happy to find that my calculation by hand got pretty close to the 
        computer's Monte Carlo method (avg 1000 random throws). However, I did find that if a 
        skilled player simply aimed for a section of a board, they would achieve much better 
        results on average. Thus, skill will always matter; some boards just show it more.
