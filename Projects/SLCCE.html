        Date: October 2024 - Present <br>
        Students Leading Collaborative Computing Education (SLCCE) is a volunteer-based student organization at NC State 
        University which aims to create opportunities for under-resourced and under-supported middle and high school students 
        in North Carolina. 
    </p>
    <p class="project">
        I have been a general body member since October 2024. I was able to contribute more especially after January, when I 
        returned to campus from my co-op. I helped design two workshops to teach middle and high school students computing concepts. 
        In March 2025, I helped presented an interactive workshop at Trinity Christian School, engaging students in hands-on learning.

        In April 2025, I became the CSC Chair. Since then, I've lead the design for the third workshop and facilitated two 
        future collaborations with other clubs. I look forward to our impact this next school year and onwards!
