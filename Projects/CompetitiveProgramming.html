        My Competitive Programming (CP) journey has been quite rocky, but I 
        am more motivated now than ever to improve and see how far I can go. So far, 
        my biggest accomplishment has been a USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) Bronze pass in 
        January of 2023. Over the summer I worked on a variety Codeforces problems and USACO Guide, 
        as well as some more common problems in CSES (repo above).
        Some of my future goals are a USACO Silver pass and a rating of 1800-2k+ on Codeforces.
        As of writing this on 9/25/23, I have gotten past validation for 4/5 problems in the 
        Practice Round of the Meta Hacker Cup! This year I'm shooting for a tshirt, which they gave to 
        the top 2000 contestants last year. Here's where I am at right now on the above:

        I did make it to round 2 of the Meta Hacker Cup but sadly I placed outside the top 2000 at around 
        3000 (out of 6000 people). I was very close to getting the problem I needed to get there. I hope to get 
        well within next year! I participated in the ICPC NAQ yesterday, and I went 5/12, solving one more shortly 
        after the contest was over. I hit my target, but I know there's a lot more to be done. Finally, I 
        attempted the January USACO Silver Contest today. I had a good idea of what each problem was asking for as 
        well as possible approaches but ultimately couldn't make significant progress within the timeframe. 
        I'm tired at the moment, so I'll try to solve them after the contest is over.
