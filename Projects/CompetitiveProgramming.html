        My Competitive Programming (CP) journey has been quite rocky, but I 
        am more motivated now than ever to improve and see how far I can go. So far, 
        my biggest accomplishment has been a USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) Bronze pass in 
        January of 2023. Over the summer I worked on a variety Codeforces problems and USACO Guide, 
        as well as some more common problems in CSES (repo above).
        Some of my future goals are a USACO Silver pass and a rating of 1800-2k+ on Codeforces.
        As of writing this on 9/25/23, I have gotten past validation for 4/5 problems in the 
        Practice Round of the Meta Hacker Cup! This year I'm shooting for a tshirt, which they gave to 
        the top 2000 contestants last year. Here's where I am at right now on the above:
