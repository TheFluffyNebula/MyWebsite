        Date: August to December 2022 <br>
        I programmed this out of pure passion: no assignment due, just some free time. 
        I made this as a guide to help my friends for the video game Clash of Clash, mainly 
        the Builder Base (aka Night Village) mode. Though this mode has been changed to where 
        it's unrecognizable, I have fond memories of it. It represents the first time I knew 
        that I was really good at something. Below are some of my accomplishments, most notably 
        finishing #36 globally and #1 in the US in April of 2022. <br> <br>
        I actually made this as soon as I learned that one could put an image inside an 
        anchor tag. That day I got home and pumped out the first twenty pages' skeletons in 
        that one night. I didn't get to sharing it around a lot, but I can say that a few friends from 
        the Netherlands used it with decent results :-) <br> <br>

        Fun fact: this is the website whose CSS this one is based on!
