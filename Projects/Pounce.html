        Date: August 2024 to Present <br>
        This project's origins lie in my participation of the NSF ACE Data Science and Analytics REU at NC A&T in summer 2024. 
        I got pretty close with my fellow researchers, and our go-to card game was pounce. In short, it's multiplayer solitaire. 
        From there, I then started thinking about how to create a web application for it. However, this project would be by far 
        the most ambitious thing I've tried to make, so I decided to break it down into smaller steps. They are as follows: <br><br>

        1. War (card game)<br>
        2. Hearts (real time) --> deployed at https://hearts-q4nx.onrender.com/<br>
        3. Solitaire (structure)<br>
        4. Pounce (combining the first three)<br><br>

        War was created with a simple stack (html/css/js). Hearts was made with React, Express, and SocketIO. 
        A quick usage guide for the render link: enter a code, then hit 'create room'. Go to console in developer tools (F12) and 
        copy the roomId. On 3 other tabs, put that roomId into the text input and hit 'join room'. The cards should show for 
        everyone in a few seconds. Note: Render may take a minute or two to spin-up. <br><br>

        Something you may notice is the relatively large time gap. I've been busy with my fall 24 co-op and school this semester. 
        As of writing this on 4/11/25, step 1 was finished in fall last year and step 2 was finished on 3/9 (deployed on render!). 
        Below are some screenshots for those. Currently, I'm trying to create solitaire.

        4/26/25 Update <br>
        I have finished solitaire (step  3/4)! I spent a bit of time each day for 16 days straight. Overall it works just like 
        the classic game, with click transitions between stock and waste and drag transitions for waste -> tableau, 
        waste -> foundation, tableau -> tableau, and tableau -> foundation. The final project will be the culmination of all of 
        this, Pounce. I plan on starting it sometime soon and hope to have the html/css done before I go on vacation. The screenshots 
        are mid-game and after it's completed.

        5/8/25 Update <br>
        I have mostly finished the frontend. Now I will start on the routes, socketry, and actual game logic to handle 
        starting rounds, ending rounds, and ending the game.
