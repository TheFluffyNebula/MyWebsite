        Date: November to December 2022 <br>
        I programmed this with Suvesh Bhusal, a fellow student at The Early College at Guilford.
        We did it for our final project in our Intro to Computer Programming class. We made a GUI 
        that allowed the user to see an instruction manual, run some preset configurations, or 
        choose their own with parameters size and generations. 
        One challenge I had was the insane logic for the grid itself. Brute forcing the corners 
        and edges and center followed by the debugging might be the single most

            difficult</a> implementation of brute force 
        I have ever attempted. My biggest fear was making a mistake in the hundreds of lines of code, and it happened.
        Another great challenge was replicating the glider gun. 
        Going to a website, copying down the coordinates of the glider gun starting configuration 
        into a text file, and then attempting Java I/O is one of the crazier ideas I am proud of coming up with. 
        Here are some screenshots of the program:
